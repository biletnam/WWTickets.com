<h1>Preparing For Your New Windows And Doors</h1>

<h2>"Your Windows Have Been Ordered!"</h2>

</div>

<p><strong>Congratulations on your decision to increase the comfort level, value and appearance of your home. To maximize your investment and enable the installation to take place as smoothly as possible, we have created this hand out to acquaint you with what to expect when our installers arrive.</strong><br/><br/>

1. <strong>ACCESS TO THE WINDOWS AND DOORS</strong> - We will need approximately 2 feel in front of each window, inside your home, so we can place our drop cloths and tools necessary to perform our work. When the old windows are removed, gusts of wind typically flow through your home. It is advisable to gather together important papers and other small items that can be disturbed by the wind or to relocate them. Computers and other electronic equipment should be covered or relocated temporarily. Please move aside any furnishings that are in the way of our work. If any furniture items are too heavy to move easily, we will gladly assist you.<br/><br/>

2. <strong>WINDOW COVERINGS</strong> - To gain access to the interior of the windows, we need all mini blinds, vertical blinds, roll-up shades, shutters, drapes and any other window coverings removed prior to our installation. If you need assistance in removing the window coverings, we can help since many window coverings are not new and may have deteriorated, however, we cannot be responsible for damage resulting in the removal and re installation. We are also not responsible for any window covering alterations that may be required to re-install them.<br/><br/>

3. <strong>PLANTS AND BUSHES</strong> - Occasionally we need to work in planters and other landscaped areas of your home that are adjacent to the windows and doors. Please survey your yard prior to our arrival and look for potential problems. Some trees and vigorous bushes need to be pruned back to give us access to your windows. Delicate plants and shrubs in areas right below a window should be temporarily relocated if they can not survive being stepped on and you want to preserve them. We strive to be careful when working around vegetation, but our priorities are to focus on our work, your windows and our safety while working on your property. We are not responsible for any damage to plants, shrubs, or landscaped areas.<br/><br/>

4. <strong>ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE TIMES</strong> - We generally arrive in the morning, depending on your distance from our office and traffic. We generally stay until the job is done unless it will be a 2- or 3- day job, in which case we may work as long as there is daylight. If this is not convenient for you and you would like the installers to leave at a certain time, please advise the Product Coordinator when he calls to set up your appointment. If you have scheduled a day off from work to do this, and you feel that inclement weather may be in the forecast for the day of your installation, call us and let us know if you would rather go to work and reschedule for a better day.<br/><br/>

5. <strong>OUR WORKSITE</strong> - We like to set up our work site as close to your windows and doors as possible and generally, your driveway is the best spot. If using the driveway will block a garaged car, please be ready to pull it out upon our arrival.<br/><br/>

6. <strong>ALARM SYSTEMS</strong> - For those of you who have alarm systems, the alarm company should be notified and advised of our job. They will be responsible for the re-connection of your alarm system. We will remove the contacts from the old sashes if you wish us to do so.<br/><br/>

7. <strong>WHERE DO WE START</strong> - Upon arrival, the crew leader will survey the job and determine where to begin. If you have a preference, feel free to advise us and we will accommodate to the best of our ability. Because we work in stages (e.g., removal of old windows, setting the new window, wrapping of exterior), we don't complete the job one window at a time. The job moves along in a "rolling progression" where each operation is done on all windows at the same time. This produces a quality job.<br/><br/>

8. <strong>IF THE JOB TAKES MORE THAN A DAY, WILL THERE BE ANY OPENINGS IN MY HOUSE?</strong> - Of course not. We only remove that which can be re-installed in the same day. Although there may not be a complete window, it will be weather tight and secure for overnight. (Please no critiquing at this time).<br/><br/>

9. <strong>PETS</strong> - We love furry, four legged creatures; however, we need your help in supervising them. We are not always able to close a gate or door behind us when carrying a window, so please keep them in a safe place. Our job description does not include scampering down the street after Fido with newfound freedom. Many people say "Don't worry; he doesn't bite," but many installers have been bitten. So please secure dogs that have an aggressive bark towards strangers.<br/><br/>

10.<strong> EXPECT SOME DUST, NOISE AND GENERAL DISRUPTION OF YOUR LIVING SPACE</strong> - Construction work can sometimes be messy depending on the scope of your job. It's an unfortunate reality of remodeling, but we do our best to keep things under control. We appreciate your patience and understanding during the job and until everything is finished. Even after we have cleaned up and vacuumed your carpets, it is advisable to survey the areas for something we may have overlooked (e.g., kids rooms, baby's room).<br/><br/>

11.<strong> DAMAGE TO WALLS AND OLD TRIM STOPS</strong> - For those of you who have old aluminum and steel windows and are replacing them due to sweating and damaging of the walls, be advised that all water damaged plaster will most likely fall out. In addition, all the patchwork you have done over the years will fall out. This is normal; however, we are not plaster experts, so the repair to those walls would best be left to the experts. If your trim stops around your sashes are very old, dry and brittle, they may snap and crack upon removal. If this happens, we can leave them off if you please, or for a small up-charge, we will replace them with newer ones. Many of the old style stops are no longer available. So we would replace the entire window with newer style stops.<br/><br/>

12.<strong> RELAX AND ENJOY THE SHOW</strong> - After we've been introduced to your home, feel free to run errands, take a walk or just relax. If a question should arise, by all means ask the crew leader for clarification. We enjoy people who are interested in what we do, and most customers are intrigued with the process. We do get nervous, however, when a customer constantly hovers over our shoulder. Like any professional, we're always happy to answer questions, but we appreciate being able to concentrate on our work without interruptions and distractions. This ensures a safe and quality installation. (Please don't offer to help, our insurance won't allow it). Please plan to be present once the job is complete. The crew leader will want you to inspect the finished job to ensure your complete satisfaction.<br/><br/></p>
